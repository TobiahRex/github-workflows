# Create a Repo

1. Go to github and create a new repository.
    - Alternative Solution is to write a shell script to generate a new repo for you from a bash script using an access token. Some extra setup, but if one were lazy, they could copy/paste a solution from [here](https://github.com/Joe-a-d/CLI/blob/master/git-new/git-new), and optimize this process into a tiny macro.
2. `gra origin <origin url>`
    - Attach your local directory to a github repository
